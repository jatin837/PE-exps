# OBJECTIVE
To obtain the characteristics of SCR Using PSPICE simulation software and obtain the value of latching the holding current.

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED
PSPICE/LTSPICE Software.

# DEVICES USED
SCR 2N1595

# PROCEDURE
- Make the connections as per the schematic and fix the value V1 and V2 at min level.
- Set the value of gate current to 2mA by adjusting the value of V2 and R2
- Give a sinusodal voltage of 30 V at 50 Hz and run the simulation for 20ms.
- Obtain the characteristics of SCR with anode to cathode voltage on x-axis and anode current on y-axis and analyse
	- forward blocking mode
	- forward conduction mode
	- reverse blocking mode
